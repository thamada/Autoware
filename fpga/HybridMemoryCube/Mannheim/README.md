# The openHMC controller: a Configurable Open-Source Hybrid Memory Cube Controller

openHMC is an open-source project developed by the Computer Architecture Group (CAG) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. It is a vendor-agnostic, AXI-4 compliant Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) controller that can be parameterized to different data-widths, external lane-width requirements, and clock speeds depending on speed and area requirements.

The main objective of developing the HMC controller is to lower the barrier for others to experiment with the HMC, without the risks of using commercial solutions.

For more information check the official openHMC documentation, available here on opencores.org or on the official project.
